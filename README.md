# ✨ Spindle ✨: For Those Who Want a 5

Sparkle is a new programming language designed specifically for those familiar with the AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) curriculum. It allows you to practice the actual code found in the exam as real, working code. 

**Why Sparkle?**

* **Intuitive Syntax:** Sparkle utilizes keywords and operators that mirror those found in the AP CSP exam, making the transition from theory to practice seamless.
* **Focus on Fundamentals:** Sparkle helps you solidify your understanding of core programming concepts like variables, conditional statements, loops, and functions.
* **Interactive Learning:** Write code, experiment with the language, and debug in a safe and engaging environment.

## **Getting Started:**

Before you start sparkling your way to coding mastery, you'll need to download and set up Sparkle: 

**1. Download Sparkle:**

Head over to the releases section of the Sparkle GitHub repository and download the latest version of the `sparkle.py` and `shell.py` files: [You can find them here!](https://github.com/matthewl580/Sparkle)
You'll also want to download Python [Which you can do here!](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**2. Create a Project Folder:**

Create a new folder on your computer where you'll store your Sparkle code. Name it whatever you want.

**3. Extract Sparkle Files:**

Extract the downloaded  files into your project folder. You should have two files in it so far: `sparkle.py` and `shell.py`.

**4. Write Your Sparkle Code:**

Create a new text file within your project folder and save it with a filename ending in `.spkl` (e.g., `my_first_program.spkl`). This file will contain your Sparkle code.

**Example Sparkle Code:**

```sparkle
# This program asks the user for their name and prints a greeting.

name <-- input("What is your name? ")
DISPLAY("Hello" + name + " !")
```

**5. Run Your Code:**
This can be done in two ways:
- Simple Method
1. Run the `shell.py` file
2. Type `RUN("[FILENAME].spkl")`, replacing `[FILENAME]` with the actual filename of your Sparkle code file (e.g., `my_first_program.spkl`)

- Advanced Method
1. Open a terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to your project folder using the `cd` command.
3. Run the below command, replacing `[FILENAME]` with the actual filename of your Sparkle code file (e.g., `my_first_program.spkl`):

```
python shell.py RUN("[FILENAME].spkl")
```

**Explanation:**

* `python shell.py`: This executes the `shell.py` script, which acts as a bridge between your Sparkle code and the Sparkle interpreter.
* `RUN("[FILENAME].spkl")`: This tells the shell to run the Sparkle code contained within the specified file.

**Press Enter** and watch your Sparkle code come to life! The shell will display the output of your program.

## **Additional Resources:**

* Feel free to explore the Sparkle GitHub repository for more information: [link to Sparkle Github repository](https://github.com/matthewl580/Sparkle)
* We recommend referring to the AP CSP reference sheet as a helpful guide: [link to AP CSP reference sheet](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-exam-reference-sheet.pdf)

**Get Sparking!**

Now that you've got the basics down, dive deeper into Sparkle and explore the world of programming with familiar concepts. Remember, practice makes perfect! Write code, experiment with different functionalities, and have fun learning!
